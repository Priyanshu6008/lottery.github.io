# Lottery Game

This project is a simple lottery game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive interface for users to select tickets and start the lottery draw.

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the lottery game interface.
2. Ten tickets are displayed on the screen, numbered from 01 to 10. Each ticket has a "SELECT" button.
3. Click on any ticket's "SELECT" button to choose that ticket. The selected ticket number will be logged to the console.
4. Once all participants have selected their tickets, click the "Start Lottery" button to begin the draw.
5. A random winner will be selected, and the result will be logged to the console.
6. If the selected ticket matches the winning number, a "Congratulations" GIF will be displayed.
7. If the selected ticket does not match the winning number, a "Better luck next time" GIF will be displayed.
8. The page will automatically refresh after 3 seconds to restart the lottery.
